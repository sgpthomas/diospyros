* Experiments with adding Vector rules generated by Ruler

It was too memory intensive to include the entire VecLang for discovering rewrite rules. And so I've only generated rules for VecAdd, VecMinus, Vec, Concat.

| Benchmark          | Add Ruler |  No Ruler | Only use Ruler for Vec rules |
|--------------------+-----------+-----------+------------------------------|
| q-prod/4r          |     27.01 |     37.01 |                        38.05 |
| qr-decomp/3_4r     | 163189.27 | 163190.01 |                    163190.07 |
| 2d-conv/3x3_2x2_4r |    13.158 |    15.158 |                        15.37 |
| mat-mul/2x2_2x2_4r |      2.05 |      2.05 |                         2.05 |
